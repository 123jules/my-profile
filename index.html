    <h2>Geopolitic 🕵️‍♂️</h2>
    <p>Since my childhood, I have always had a penchant for history, that of the kings of France, Napoleon or the Second World War, But as I grew older, I became aware that the world around us was constantly changing and that every day new conflicts arose for different reasons: religion, oil and many others.  Since then, I love to learn, understand the origin of the problems and know what the different parties are doing to solve them.

    <h2>Gym 🏋️‍♀️</h2>
    <p>This sport may seem at first glance rather boring and repetitive however it has been of great help to me to gain confidence in myself. What I also appreciate is being able to see his body transform over the months, becoming more enduring to the effort.  💪

    <h2> Reading  🙇‍♂️</h2>
    <p>My passion for reading developed at the same time as that for geo-politics. Discover new stories and be transported to a new universe whether fictional or centuries old and something that I enjoy more and more. I discovered very good authors such as Hemingway for example.
